**Back to School**

I just started my first semester as a TA for CS3410: Computer System Organization and Programming.
We're revving up the semester with some float math and pointer logic.

**New Personal Project Ideation**

Beyond that, I've been dreaming up a new iteration of my [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) wrapper template project for Unity
that's a little more flexible and artist-friendly. On the web side of things, I've been rolling
around an idea for a web app that lets artists share dailies with each other. Sort of like a private Inktober
support group.
