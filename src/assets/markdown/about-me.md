**Nice To Meet You!**

As you've probably heard, my name is Caroline Hohner. I plan to graduate from Cornell with a major in Computer Science and minor in Game Design next spring. Last summer, I interned at Jump Trading, and before that I was a SWE intern at WW Grainger, Inc.

At school, I am a member of the Imaging Systems subteam on Cornell Unmanned Air Systems and a TA for CS3410: Computer System Organization and Programming. I am also active in the game design community at Cornell â€” check out my projects to learn more!

I am currently a TA for CS3410: Computer System Organization and Programming. Previously, I have been a TA for CS4152: Advanced Topics in Computer Game Architecture, and an Academic Excellence Workshops Facilitator for CS1110: Introduction to Computing: A Design and Development Perspective and CS3110: Data Structures and Functional Programming.
