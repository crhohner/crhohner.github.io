**Bubblegum Bandit**

A semester-long project for Cornell's 3152: Intro to Game Development, Bubblegum Bandit was developed by a team of eight including programmers, artists, and UI/UX designers. The game was written using LibGDX, a Java game development framework. Bubblegum Bandit is available to play on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2460680/Bubblegum_Bandit/) and was presented at the 2024 PAX East convention.
