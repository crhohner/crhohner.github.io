**Trigger Happy**

In an alternate 1920s Chicago, gun-slinging beasts rule the streets. A deadly shootout breaks out between rival mobsters. With danger closing in, you must make split-second choices—steal, shoot, outsmart. Who will be the last animal standing?

Trigger Happy is a turn-based, last-man-standing mobile game where players defeat their opponents by choosing actions such as shooting, stealing, or reflecting bullets. It is targeted towards groups of 3-6 players.
